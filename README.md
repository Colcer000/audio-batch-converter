# Audio Batch Converter
A python script that converts audio files, artwork and metadata into listen-ready formats. It uses ffmpeg for audio formatting and MusicBrainz for metadata completion.
*For the script to work, make sure the audio files have artist and title in the metadata.*

How to use:
- Install ffmpeg and copy "ffmpeg.exe" in "_internal" folder (download separately);
- Place all the desired songs in the same folder as the script;
- If you have better pictures to add to the audio, rename them to the name of the audio file and keep them in the same folder with the audio and the script;
- Run the script;
- Apply desired settings and start batch conversion.
